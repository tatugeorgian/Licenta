Requirements : JDK version 11.0.1 and JavaFx SDK version 11.0.2

In order to run the application unzip the archive and change the path to the JavaFx SDK from the start.bat file. 
You may add an environment variable or an absolute path.

If you are using Linux or Mac you may have to run chmod on start.bat in order to give it execution rights.
Also don't forget to add #!/bin/bash on the first line.

If you have done all this just run start.bat.
